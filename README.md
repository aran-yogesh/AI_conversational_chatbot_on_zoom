# AI Conversational ChatBot on Zoom 🤖

For me, Zoom was just for meetings.🧑‍💻 I never imagined that I would build an AI Chatbot on it. Isn’t it amazing to have a bot that can assist you with your queries during virtual meetings (especially when you're sleeping in between the meetings)? 🎓 I'm a student. So if you ask me, yes!!! It is a crazy thing. 
That’s what my next project is about!!

🤔 I built another AI chatbot, (oh, wait)...

✨ An **Intelligent AI ChatBot** 

that provides helpful responses to user queries on a wide range of topics within their Zoom conversation discussions by using Cerebras' advanced language models on the Zoom Developers’ platform.😊

## Functionalities:

* Respond to user messages in Zoom Team Chat using Cerebras' language models.
* Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses.
* Can be used in direct messages or invoked in group chats and channels.
* Provides helpful information, answers questions, assists with tasks, and engages in discussions on various topics with exceptional speed and accuracy.
* In the end, I will share my experience on how My Bot assisted me during the project when I got stuck.

## Architecture:

### 4. Setting up a webhook receiver:

   * refer //server.js file.
   * To use this: First install node.
     
  If you do not have node installed, install it first:

   ```
   brew install node@22
   ```

  
  Install Expree:
  ```
  npm install express
  ```


  Run the server:
  ```
  node server.js
  ```


### 5. Create a new file .env:

   ```
   ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_client_id
   ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_client_secret
   ZOOM_BOT_JID=your_zoom_bot_jid
   CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_cerebras_api_key
   ```

### 6. Send ChatBot Message:

   * Refer //sendMessage.js file.
   * Generating an Access token (refer token.js)


### 7. Let's move on [Cerebras:](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/quickstart)

   * Install the Cerebras Inference library
     ```
     npm install @cerebras/cerebras_cloud_sdk
     ```

   * Create Cerebras file

     refer //cerebras.js file.

### 8. What next?

Nothing, Your Conversational ChatBot is ready!!! 

This chatbot will now have a conversation history, which will enable it to end up being more logical and less awkward. As a part of the code, previous messages are saved in memory and attached each time to the subsequent requests to the Cerebras API. This will help the AI to grasp the flow of the conversation and be able to recall what has been said before in the conversation.


* You can also launch your app in Zoom Team Chat with configured shortcuts that will trigger the defined action.

You know, what was the best part?
I was stuck in between the coding part, my Bot motivated me by saying kind words.

That was my experience with AI tools. I would love to know your story with AI...
